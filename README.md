Solutions to some leet code problems
# Coin2Change.py:
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
# Find in Mountain Array:
Solution in Mountain_array.py
You may recall that an array A is a mountain array if and only if:

A.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that:
A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]
A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]
Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target.  If such an index doesn't exist, return -1.

You can't access the mountain array directly.  You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:

MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.
Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. 

# N Queens
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

# Delete Nodes And Return Forest
Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.
After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).
Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

# Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree
Given a binary tree with the following rules:

root.val == 0
If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.left != null, then treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1
If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.right != null, then treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2
Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all treeNode.val have been changed to -1.

You need to first recover the binary tree and then implement the FindElements class:

FindElements(TreeNode* root) Initializes the object with a contamined binary tree, you need to recover it first.
bool find(int target) Return if the target value exists in the recovered binary tree.
